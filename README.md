# 🌍 LandWatch

**LandWatch** is a Jupyter-based interactive application that enables anyone to monitor global land surface changes over time using satellite imagery—without requiring prior GIS knowledge. Powered by **Google Earth Engine** and **Python**, the tool lets users draw a region of interest (ROI), then generate high-quality time-series animations for surface water (MNDWI), vegetation (NDVI), and urbanization (NDBI).
